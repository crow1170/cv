Web development
---------------

After enjoying web services at home and bringing the benefits of web apps into the office,
I became convinced that good software transforms work. So this year I learnt how to code.
I started with a six week part-time online course from UCBerkeley,
then left my job to attend Makers Academy full-time for three months.
I'm ready to work on real projects and mature my skills as a full stack web developer.
